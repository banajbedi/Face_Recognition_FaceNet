# Face Detection and Recognition using Face Net

Face Net generates high-quality face mapping from the images using deep learning architectures such as ZF-Net and Inception Network. Then it uses a method called triplet loss as a loss function to train this architecture.
 
This model is trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with backpropagation and AdaGrad.

I have used a custom dataset of Friends casts images.
